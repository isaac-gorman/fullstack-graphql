// Overview
// - There are many directives that exist on the client side, such as: 
// - - '@skip()': enables you to pass argumnets based on some conditional statement
//  - - '@include()'
// - Furthermore their are more experimental directives that depend on a third party in order to function, such as: 
//  - - '@live'
//  - - '@defer'

// So far I have only used one out of the box client side directive: 
// @client that tells apollo to pull this out of the clients schema
